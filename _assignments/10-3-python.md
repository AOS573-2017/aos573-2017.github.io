# Assignment
Sorting procedures are incredibly important when doing scientific programming, however, the way you sort through data depends on the size of the dataset.  Implement three different ways of sorting through a 1-dimensional list.  For each case, write out the pseudo-code the prodedure, explaining your methodology. You can choose if you want to sort from low to high, by increments, bin the data, etc.  This homework is to test the creativity of your logical thinking.  


## Help
For this assignment, the numpy module will be extremely helpful.  The functions you may use include:
* interpolate
* linspace
* percentile


To initialize nested lists within a listen (a 2-d array in other languages) in Python, use the one line expression of the form:

~~~ python
nested_list = [ [] for n in range(10) ]
~~~
will create 0-9 (Python is an exclusive language) lists within the list `nested_list.`  


As a hint, in the MatLab sections, Zach had you implement sorting of the arrays.  This can be recreated in Python as one of your three ways.
