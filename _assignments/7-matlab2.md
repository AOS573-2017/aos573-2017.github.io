# Assignment
1. Generate a script that loads in KMSN.csv
2. In the same script, calculate the correlation coefficients between temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed.
3. Calculate and plot the probability distribution functions, and the extreme cumulative distribution functions for the three variables.

4. In a new script, load in flash_rate.mat, this file ranges from 45N to 45S, and has a horizontal resolution of 0.5 degrees.
5. Make a filled contour plot, with no edges of the log of the lightning flash rate. This contour plot should have correct latitudes and longitudes.
6. Interpolate this data to 2 degree resolution.
6. Calculate and plot the probability distribution functions, and the extreme cumulative distribution functions of the interpolated lightning flash rate.

The scripts should be uploaded to the dropbox. You will be evaluated on whether these scripts produce the figures and correlations asked for, and if your figure looks correct.
