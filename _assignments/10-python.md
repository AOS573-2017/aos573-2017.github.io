# Assignment
Fizzbuzz
Write a script that prints out the numbers n to N but...
	if the number is divisible by 3 the script prints Fizz and not the number
	if the number is divisible by 5 the script prints Buzz and not the number
	if the number is divisible by 3 AND 5 the script prints FizzBuzz and not the number

Do this in three different ways utilizing different programming tehcniques (both good and bad).
At the end of the exercise, you will pseudo-code walk the class through the worst way you thought of implementing FizzBuzz and the best way you thought of implementing FizzBuzz.
