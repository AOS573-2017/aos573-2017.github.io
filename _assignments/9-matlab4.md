This again will be a group assignment for coveted Zach points. However, everybody will still have to code in their own script and upload it the dropbox for grading.

# Assignment

1a load in `aos573_week9.mat`

This data contains pressure, height, precipitating water (QP) (g/kg), and temperature (K).

1b Define some x and y coordinates for our plotting.

2a Make a filled contour plot of QP at the 10th vertical level. 
2b Decide upon a good range of values to make these contours
2c Turn off the contour lines of the previous figure.
2d Label your axes and give a title!

3 In script, save the QP contour plots of vertical levels 11-20. Break it down into steps for more Zach points.

4 Make a movie of temperature from the lowest vertical level to the highest vertical level.

5 Make it so that the title of the figure in the movie tells us at what height we are currently at.
