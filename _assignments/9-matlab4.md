This again will be a group assignment for coveted Zach points. However, everybody will still have to code in their own script and upload it the dropbox for grading.

# Assignment

1a. load in `aos573_wk9.mat`

This data contains pressure, height, pressure perturbation (Pa), precipitating water (g/kg), temperature (K), and updraft velocity (m/s).

1b. Define some x and y coordinates for our plotting.

2a. Make a filled contour plot of QP at the 10th vertical level. A good range of values is 0.1:0.1:1.

2b. Turn off the contour lines of the previous figure.
  
  
3. In script, save temperature contour plots of vertical levels 10-20. Break it down into steps for more Zach points.

4. Make a movie of temperature from the lowest vertical level to the highest vertical level.

5. Make it so that the title of the figure in the movie tells us at what height we are currently at.
