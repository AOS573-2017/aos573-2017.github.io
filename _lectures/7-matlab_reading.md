# Reading data in Matlab

Matlab can be both easier and more difficult to read in data compared to Fortran and Python. Simply jumping through lines to read in a text file in Fortran or Python only takes a couple of lines of code at most, however, in Matlab, this can be seen as a semi-impossible task to do by hand. Luckily, Matlab has many built in applications that can make reading in data fairly easy. The most important thing to learn about it the `generate script`, or `generate function` command.
