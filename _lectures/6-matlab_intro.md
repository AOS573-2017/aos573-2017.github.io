# Matlab Overview
Matlab was originally written by a CS professor at the University of New Mexico who didn't want to force his students to learn Fortran in order to use numerical algrabraic and statistical tools. Matlab, unlike Fortran is not a compiled programming language; once you've written a script, all you need to do is run it. Matlab also has a very nice GUI to make writing and running code, as well as visualizing data quite comfortable.

Some major differences in terms of coding syntax from Fortran include not having to define your variable types, Matlab does it for you (and usually does a pretty good job!). Also, Matlab is case sensitive regarding any variables you create.
