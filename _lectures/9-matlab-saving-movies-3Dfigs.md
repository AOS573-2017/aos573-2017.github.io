This week, we will be focusing on how to save figures inside your script, how to make movies, and finally, if we have time, making 3-dimensional figures. The application of saving figures inside your script is fairly obvious, if you need to make a large number of figures, it is much more efficient to simply save them in your script rather than save and edit them by hand. Creating movies is obviously a fairly useful thing, not super applicable in terms of systematic analysis, but very useful for visualization and making presentations. 3D figures can be quite nice for the visualization of your results, but unless you have a good reason for making them, they are relatively clunky compared to 2D figures, which are easier for our minds to handle.
